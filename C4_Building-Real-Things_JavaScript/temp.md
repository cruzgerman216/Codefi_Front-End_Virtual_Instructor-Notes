## DOM & DOM Events

- Look through the document object and events in JavaScript

- 3 Ways of the same functionality in JavaScript

- It is cleanest to have all teh functionality in JavaSciprt (seperation of concerns)

- To do this the easiest... create five buttons from the start and do the HTML than the JavaScirpt....

1. Grab the body element (document.body or document.querySelector())
2. Create a function that changes the background color of the body
3. Create the html markup with a button in the center of the screen that calls the onclick for that function
4. Create another button, remove the onlcick
5. Setup an event listener in javascript and do the same functionality as before
6. Create another button
7. Change the querySelector to querySelectorAll and loop over each button and sest the onclick dynamically in javascript
8. Create another button in the HTML
9. Add an event listener in JavaSCript for mouseEnter or click that runs the same function... you can do this using the querySelectorAll as well
